I'm Eli, a MSc student in Mathematics at Brigham Young University (BYU). I am lucky to work with [Jared Whitehead](https://science.byu.edu/directory/jared-whitehead) and [Tyler Jarvis](https://science.byu.edu/directory/tyler-jarvis) on problems surrounding theoretical machine learning, generalization, and double descent. 

Prior to starting my Masters, I graduated from the Applied and Computational Math ([ACME]([https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io])(https://acme.byu.edu)) program at BYU. During my time as an undergrad, I worked on problems on zeros of harmonic functions with [Jennifer Brooks](https://math.byu.edu/directory/brooks-jennifer).
